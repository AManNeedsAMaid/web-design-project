    <p>As paper suffers serious degredation over time, construction
    of an exact timeline of origami is impossible. Paper was
    invented in China around 105 A.D., and traditional paper
    folding is an important part of Chinese and Korean history.
    However, the Japanese were the first culture to popularise
    paper folding as an <em>art form.</em></p><img src=

    <p>Before 1880, Origami was referred to as orikata, or "folded
    shapes". The word comes from the Japanese <em>oru</em> (to
    fold) and <em>kami</em> (paper)</p>
    <p>Although origami is an extremely accessible passtime today,
    it was not so originally. At first, origami was reserved for
    the elite of Japanese society. Monks folded origami as a part
    of religious worship, and origami was also used during
    ceremonies, such weddings.</p><img src=

    <p>The first book about origami was published in 1797. Written
    by Akisato Rito, the Sembazuru Orikata. The book discusses
    origami's affect on culture, and not step by step
    instructions.</p><img src="imgs/cranes.webp">
    <p>There is a traditional story in Japan that claims if someone
    folds 1,000 origami cranes, they will be granted a wish.</p>
